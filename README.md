# Retail Business CRM Project

This project is a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system specifically designed for retail businesses. It's built using Python, one of the most popular and versatile programming languages, known for its readability and efficiency.

The CRM system aims to improve the relationship with existing customers, find new prospective customers, and win back former customers. This system is designed to compile information across different channels or points of contact between the customer and the company which could include the company's website, telephone, live chat, direct mail, marketing materials, and social media.

Through the CRM approach and the systems used to facilitate it, businesses learn more about their target audiences and how to best cater to their needs. The main features of this CRM include contact management, sales team and customer opportunity management, lead management for determining high-quality leads, reports and dashboards, and customisable home screen and layouts.

The project is open-source and contributions are welcome! Please read the CONTRIBUTING.md for details on our code of conduct, and the process for submitting pull requests to us.
